# My Profile

Iâ€™m an aspiring Frontend Developer with a passion for clean design and smooth user experience.
I come from a background in Digital Marketing, which helps me understand what users really want.

I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and just started exploring React and Tailwind.
I love designing simple landing pages, building prototypes in Figma, and making them responsive on any screen.

Excited to grow into a role where code and design meet.
